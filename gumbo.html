    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and devein shrimp, placing shrimp shells in a large pot. Refrigerate shrimp until needed.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, melt 1/4 cup butter over medium heat. Add shrimp shells and cook until pink. Then add broth.</li>
        <li>Bring broth to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm until needed.
        </li>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven, cook sausage until browned. Remove sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Add oil and remaining 1/4 cup butter to Dutch oven. Heat over medium heat until butter is completely melted.
        </li>
        <li>Add flour and stir with wooden spoon until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium low and cook, stirring frequently until roux is a dark caramel color. This will take 30 to 40 minutes.
