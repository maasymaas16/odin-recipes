    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds pork belly, sliced in 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salt</li>
        <li>Peanut oil for frying</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>Six 6-inch French Baguettes, toasted</li>
        <li>Louisiana-style hot sauce for spreading</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped lettuced</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced dill pickles</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Fully submerge the pork belly in a pot of water, add the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the pork belly is flaky and tender, 3 to 4 hours. Turn off the heat and drain</li>
        <li>Heat peanut oil in a fryer or large pot to 350 degrees F. Gently place handfuls of the rendered pork belly into the fryer until golden crispiness, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate or bowl and season with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Mix the mayonnaise and maple syrup in a bowl. Spread a hefty portion onto the bottom baguette halves, followed by a little squirt of the hot sauce. Top with a handful of chopped lettuce, a couple slices of dill pickles and the fried pork belly. Finish with another heavy drizzle of the mayonnaise-maple mixture. Enjoy!</li>
